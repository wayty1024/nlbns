<p>Hi lovey, love, baby, yah, pre, I hope you're doing great every time! It's been a half of a year since we became official! </p>
<p>Always remember that I love you and I miss you so much.</p>
<p>I'm always here to support you, no matter what happens in the future. I've been your No. 1 supporter since day 1!</p>
<p> I'm really sorry for letting you feel like I'm always doubting and not trusting you anymore. Your feelings are always valid for me, my love. </p>
<p> I trust you, okay! I hope you'll keep your promises to me.</p>
<p> I know it's not that easy to go back to the way we used to be, but I know it's part of our relationship. We need to grow and be strong.Â </p>
<p> More away/tampuhan, good memories, months, years, hugs, kisses, rants, chismis to come!</p>
<p> I miss our gala baby </p> 
<p> We fight, we fix, we stay! </p> 
<p>Ikaw, palagi!</p>
<p><b>I love you, my love!</p></b>
